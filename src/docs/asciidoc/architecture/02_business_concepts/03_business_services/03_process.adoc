===== To Consult the Card Feed
Actors:: Operator
Description:: Access the feed of cards which display cards with a focus and the
operator needs to accomplish its tasks. The feed of card is an interface that
allows an Operator to consult a list of previously published cards that is
continuously updated with new cards. Cards represent a state in a business
process.

Pre requisite:: Authenticated user (see <<To Authenticate>>)

.Nominal Scenario
. Access the main operator-fabric ui to display the feed of cards

.Extended Scenario
Adjust the focus on the feed:

* With temporal filter adjustment (defaults to : from now to +24 hour);;.
* With recipient adjustment (defaults to only cards where the user is main recipient)
* With type adjustment through the use of tag filters

[NOTE]
====
The filters may impact the two complementary aspects of the feed:

* previously published cards;
* card updates;

This interraction will be depicted later in the document

===== To Consult the Timeline

Actors:: Operator
Description::
Pre requisite:: Authenticated user (see <<To Authenticate>>)

===== To Consult a Card
Actors:: Operator, 3rd Party IS (Secondary in extended scenario)
Description:: Access a specific card associated business content called details
Pre requisite:: Authenticated user (see To Authenticate)

.Nominal Scenario
. Select a card in the feed to display its associated details

.Extended Scenario

===== To Start a Process Instance
Actors:: 3rd Party IS
Description:: Start a process instance
Pre requisite:: The process definition must exist.

.Nominal Scenario
. Initiate the process with corresponding initialization data
. Realize the initial state
. Issue a card for the initial state

.Error Scenario
* If the process definition does not exist:
  . Return an error to 3rd Party IS
* If the process initialization data are incorrect:
  . Return an error to 3rd Party IS
* If an error occurs during realization of the initial state:
[start=2]
  . &nbsp;
  .. Log an error
  .. Issue an error card
* If an error occurs during card issuing:
[start=3]
  . Log an error, notify administrator

[IMPORTANT]
====
There are still ongoing discussion wether a business process is:

 * an Operator Fabric internally defined concept
 * an external concept managed by a Business Process Management tool
 * an abstract concept defined by each 3rd Party Information Service

This may induce changes in actors responsibility in the present use cases

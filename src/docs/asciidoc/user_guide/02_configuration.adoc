== Configuration

As a microservice architectured solution, Operator Fabric has multiple services
to configure. These configuration are gathered by a Configuration Service that
can be redunded for safety.

See {opfab_architecture_doc}[Operator Fabric Architecture] for more information
on the different services.

All services are springboot application and share some common configuration and
uses jetty as an embedded servlet container. The following documentation
references describes Springboot configuration.

 * {springboot_doc}/reference/htmlsingle/[Springboot documentation]
 * {springboot_doc}/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config[Springboot external configuration]
 * {springboot_doc}/reference/htmlsingle/#common-application-properties[Common application properties from Springboot documentation]

=== Global configuration

Aside from the configuration service, all configurations are gathered in the
configuration service environment backend (see <<Cloud Configuration service>>)
